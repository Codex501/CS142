This is all the Project I've created while taking the class CS142: intro to Computer Science and Programming.

       12-20 credits $18,025.00
       21 or more    $18.025.00 +1502.22 per hour over 20

weather.cpp: This program will ask the user for the temperature in Fahrenheit it will then output the temperature in centigrade and if the temperature is greater than 85 Fahrenheit it will also print out that its hot,if it's below 20 it will print out its cold and if it's in between it will print nothing.
